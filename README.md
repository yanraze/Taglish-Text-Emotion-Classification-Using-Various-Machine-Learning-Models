# Taglish-Text-Emotion-Classification-Using-Various-Machine-Learning-Models
This project evaluates Taglish text 
emotion classification (joy, sadness, fear, and anger) using known machine learning techniques, including SVM, 
Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.  Additionally, it only focuses on text content and does 
not consider other modalities such as images, speech, and audiovisuals. Lastly, the 
study does not classify complex emotional expressions such as irony, 
sarcasm, negation, and emojis.
